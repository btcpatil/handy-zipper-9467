          <h3>From Humble Beginnings</h3>
          <p>
            While riding through the forests of Burma, our founder, Mr. M.
            Manal, saw a villager pacify a restless elephant by feeding it the
            root of the plant Rauwolfia serpentina.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fascinated by the plant's effect on the elephant, he returned home
            to India to seek scientific evidence for why this particular plant
            would have such a beneficial, calming effect. Young Manal's mother
            gave him her bangles to sell so he could pursue his work, and
            Himalaya was born.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once he fully understood the science behind this special botanical,
            Mr. Manal bought a hand-operated, tablet-compressing machine and
            began his work. At night, his shoulders would ache from producing a
            few hundred tablets, one small tablet at a time. But his hard work
            paid off. This remarkable plant would later become Serpina, the
            world’s first anti-hypertensive drug in 1934.
          </p>
          <p>
            We remain in awe of the man who began our company, and the
            grandfather of our current CEO, Nabeel Manal. Himalaya’s legacy has
            always been one of researching nature and using the tools of modern
            science to develop and produce Ayurveda-based, pharmaceutical-grade
            herbal medicine products. And today, that legacy continues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Manal had a vision of helping people be well. Today, Himalaya
            Herbal Healthcare has turned a time-honored herbal tradition into a
            complete range of contemporary, proprietary formulas and single
            herbs dedicated to making the world well one person at a time.

          <h3>Our Roots</h3>
          <p>
            The herbs used in Himalaya Herbal Healthcare's scientific product
            line are also used in the world's oldest traditional system of
            medicine, Ayurveda, which dates back over 4,000 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The word Ayurveda comes from the Sanskrit root words ayur, meaning
            “life” and veda, meaning “to know.” Ayurveda literally means "to
            know life,” or in the language of today, “the science of life.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Ayurveda had a profound, far-reaching influence on Traditional
            Chinese Medicine and the healthcare systems of many other countries
            and cultures that followed. Today, thanks to the dedicated efforts
            of Himalaya’s doctors and scientists, it’s been proven effective
            through scientific validation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ayurveda acknowledges there are five elements that make up the
            universe and the human body; earth, water fire, air and space. It
            seeks to bring the constellation and characteristics of the three
            body types defined by those elements – the vata, pitta and kapha –
            back into balance through proper diet, herbal treatment, and
            emotional well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re proud of the ancient roots and our modern branches that allow
            us to continue unlocking the powerful healing benefits of Ayurveda,
            but our formulas are science-based and appropriate for all body
            types. They require no Ayurvedic knowledge to be used successfully.

          <h3>Purity and Efficacy</h3>
          <p>
            The complexity and timing of the entire seed-to-shelf process for
            Himalaya and for the plants themselves, is highlighted by three
            important mandates: purity, efficacy, and batch-to-batch
            consistency.
          </p>
          <p>
            We know the success of traditional plant medicine is based on
            several integral parts that extend from the most advanced
            agricultural research and practices, to extraction methodologies, to
            formulating approaches and dosage strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            To accomplish all of this, Himalaya maintains total control over the
            farming, harvesting, research, manufacturing, and distribution of
            all our products.

          <h3>Our Farms</h3>
          <p>
            Himalaya's herbs are grown on over 1,000 acres of farmland through
            fair trade, farming partnerships. Herbs are also sustainably
            wildcrafted on over 5,000 acres.
          </p>
          <p>
            Farms are located in regions most suitable to the individual herb so
            that the best possible quality and potency are achieved in the
            harvest. Just as one wine grape has more character and flavor when
            grown in a very specific region, the plants used in healthcare often
            perform best when they’re grown and harvested in their own unique
            native soil.
          </p>

          Himalaya chooses farm lands based on soil fertility, suitability and
          quality, visiting the selected land first to ensure the land is free
          from soil and water erosion, free from pollution and away from
          industrial zones, free from municipal waste and the flow of rain water
          from neighboring fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Farmers are trained in preparing the land, through to post-harvest
          management of the herbs, and even in proper drying, packaging, storing
          and labeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Himalaya’s farmers use only authenticated starting materials; viable
          seeds with a good germination percentage. A respective Package of
          Practices (POP) assures adherence to quality, sustainability and
          careful environmental stewardship at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Farmers are trained on earth-friendly organic practices, soil bed
          preparation, proper irrigation, fertilization and sustainable
          harvesting, crop rotation, cover crop cultivation and organic soil
          enrichment. No pesticides are allowed to be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Careful safety measures are put in place for handling threatened plant
          populations, and farmers are continually trained on the Good
          Cultivation Practices specific to each herb. In addition, farmers are
          trained on Good Agriculture Collection Practices as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to initial training, two residential workshops are
          conducted per year, and supervisors visit the farmer’s field regularly
          to check for compliance in areas such as proper crop management, no
          chemical usage, no child labor, and appropriate labor hours for
          adults. Violations do not occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Himalaya’s agricultural supervisory teams visit farms quarterly, but
          the frequency of visits may increase depending on the individual needs
          of the farmer. Himalaya’s inspectors and trainers include our own
          people with Masters Degrees in botany, MBAs in agri-business
          management, along with agricultural scientists from reputed
          universities.

            In March 2001, Himalaya was granted a Good Manufacturing Practices
            (GMP) certificate, issued by the Licensing Authority, Directorate of
            Indian Systems of Medicine, Bangalore, India. Himalaya is the first
            Ayurvedic facility in India to receive GMP certification.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have also been granted Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
            certification. A GLP certification is granted to manufacturing
            companies that adhere to the toxicity guidelines in nonclinical
            safety studies. The certification is granted by the National Good
            Laboratory Practice (GLP) Compliance Monitoring Authority,
            Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only 14 institutions in India have been granted this certificate,
            and Himalaya is the first herbal company to join their ranks.

        <p>Himalaya has been planting trees in the Western Ghats of India since 2011. The Western Ghats is identified as a biodiversity hotspot by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</p>
        <p>To date, we have planted 750,000 trees, covering 900 acres in partnership with a local non-government organization, the Society for Environment and Biodiversity Conservation. Himalaya supports the planting of a mix of fruit, fodder, endemic, medicinal and other trees that support the local ecology and biodiversity.</p>
        <p>Some of the medicinal trees planted include Ashwagandha, Arjuna, Amla and Hirada. The program also supports the planting of fruit trees such as mango, papaya, banana and cashew nut, which generate income to local farmers in the program and serve as supplementary nutrition. In addition, we have also planted Abutilon ranadei, a native plant that is critically endangered.</p>

        <h3>Certification for Environmental Management</h3>
        <p>Himalaya has taken several steps to conserve water, power and reduce pollution to meet National Quality Assurance (NQA) guidelines. The most significant achievement has been setting up a water treatment plant and sourcing water with low Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) externally. This has reduced Himalaya’s water consumption by as much as 10,000 liters a day.</p>
        <p>Himalaya has been awarded ISO-14001:2004 certification, the most recognized standard globally, for environment management. The certification is granted by National Quality Assurance (NQA), the UK's largest established certification body.</p>
