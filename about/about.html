          <h3>From Humble Beginnings</h3>
          <p>
            While riding through the forests of Burma, our founder, Mr. M.
            Manal, saw a villager pacify a restless elephant by feeding it the
            root of the plant Rauwolfia serpentina.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fascinated by the plant's effect on the elephant, he returned home
            to India to seek scientific evidence for why this particular plant
            would have such a beneficial, calming effect. Young Manal's mother
            gave him her bangles to sell so he could pursue his work, and
            Himalaya was born.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once he fully understood the science behind this special botanical,
            Mr. Manal bought a hand-operated, tablet-compressing machine and
            began his work. At night, his shoulders would ache from producing a
            few hundred tablets, one small tablet at a time. But his hard work
            paid off. This remarkable plant would later become Serpina, the
            world’s first anti-hypertensive drug in 1934.
          </p>
          <p>
            We remain in awe of the man who began our company, and the
            grandfather of our current CEO, Nabeel Manal. Himalaya’s legacy has
            always been one of researching nature and using the tools of modern
            science to develop and produce Ayurveda-based, pharmaceutical-grade
            herbal medicine products. And today, that legacy continues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Manal had a vision of helping people be well. Today, Himalaya
            Herbal Healthcare has turned a time-honored herbal tradition into a
            complete range of contemporary, proprietary formulas and single
            herbs dedicated to making the world well one person at a time.
